### Redwire Econotag - mc13224v dev. board ###


MC13224 ARM7 802.15.4 SoC dev. kit with on-board JTAG

The perfect development and project board for the Freescale MC13224v ARM7 microcontroller and 802.15.4 radio. An onboard FT2232 provides access to the JTAG interface, and UART1. The board is powered over USB.
Debug with OpenOCD and GDB.

On board ROM bootloader for flashing.

no other programming hardware is necessary!

Board can be externally powered up to 16V for easy integration into prototypes or use with batteries in low power applications.
